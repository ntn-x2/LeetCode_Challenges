# 223. Rectangle Area

Given the coordinates of two **rectilinear** rectangles in a 2D plane, return *the total area covered by the two rectangles*.

The first rectangle is defined by its **bottom-left** corner `(A, B)` and its **top-right** corner `(C, D)`.

The second rectangle is defined by its **bottom-left** corner `(E, F)` and its **top-right** corner `(G, H)`.

**Example 1**:

```
Input: A = -3, B = 0, C = 3, D = 4, E = 0, F = -1, G = 9, H = 2

Output: 45
```

**Example 2**:

```
Input: A = -2, B = -2, C = 2, D = 2, E = -2, F = -2, G = 2, H = 2

Output: 16
```

**Constraints**:

- -10<sup>4</sup> <= A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H <= 10<sup>4</sup>
